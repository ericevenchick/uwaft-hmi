KVASER SOFTWARE LICENSE STATEMENT AND LIMITED WARRANTY
======================================================

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY
This license statement and limited warranty constitutes a legal
agreement ("License Agreement") between you (either as an individual
or a single entity) and KVASER AB, Kinnahult, Sweden, ("KVASER") for
the software product ("Software") identified above, including any
software, media, and accompanying on-line or printed documentation.

BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT.
If you are the original purchaser of the Software and you do not
agree with the terms and conditions of the License Agreement,
promptly return the unused Software to the place from which you
obtained it for a full refund.

Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the License
Agreement, KVASER grants you the right to use the Software in the
manner provided below.

This Software is owned by KVASER or its suppliers and is protected by
copyright law and international copyright treaty.  Therefore, you
must treat this Software like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a
book), except that you may either make copies of the Software solely
for backup or archival purposes or transfer the Software to a
computer readable medium, e.g. a hard disk, provided you keep the
original solely for backup or archival purposes.

You may transfer the Software and documentation on a permanent basis
provided you retain no copies and the recipient agrees to the terms
of the License Agreement.  Except as provided in the License
Agreement, you may not transfer, rent, lease, lend, copy, modify,
translate, sublicense, time-share or electronically transmit or
receive the Software, media or documentation.  You acknowledge that
the Software in source code form remains a confidential trade secret
of KVASER and/or its suppliers and therefore you agree not to modify
the Software or attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or
disassemble the Software, except and only to the extent that such
activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding
this limitation.

If you have purchased an upgrade version of the Software, it
constitutes a single product with the KVASER software that you
upgraded.  You may use or transfer the upgrade version of the
Software only in accordance with the License Agreement.


GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO COMPILED PROGRAMS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES
You may write and compile (including byte-code compile) your own
application programs using the Software, including any libraries and
source code included for such purpose with the Software. You may
reproduce and distribute, in executable form only, programs which you
create using the Software without additional license or fees, subject
to all of the conditions in this statement.

KVASER products may include certain files ("Redistributables")
intended for distribution by you to the users of programs you create.
Redistributables include, for example, those files identified in the
accompanying printed or on-line documentation as redistributable
files.  In any event, the Redistributables for the Software are only
those files specifically designated as such by KVASER.  From time to
time, KVASER may designate other files as Redistributables.  You
should refer to the documentation, including any "readme" or "deploy"
files included with the Software, for additional information.

Subject to all of the conditions in this statement, you may reproduce
and distribute exact copies of the Redistributables, provided that
such copies are made from the original copy of the Software or the
copy transferred to the hard disk, or obtained from KVASER's web
site, http://www.kvaser.com.  Copies of Redistributables may only be
distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing application
programs permitted under this statement that you have created using
the Software.  Under no circumstances may any copies of
Redistributables be distributed separately.  Regardless of any
modifications which you make and regardless of how you might compile,
link, and/or package your programs, under no circumstances may the
libraries (including runtime libraries), code, Redistributables,
and/or other files of the Software (including any portions thereof)
be used for developing programs by anyone other than you.  Only you
as the licensed user (or the Named User for your entity) have the
right to use the libraries (including runtime libraries), code,
Redistributables, or other files of the Software (or any portions
thereof) for developing programs created with the Software.  In
particular, you may not share copies of the Redistributables with
other co-developers.  You may not reproduce or distribute any KVASER
documentation without KVASER's permission.

The license granted in this statement for you to create your own
compiled programs and distribute your programs and the
Redistributables (if any) is subject to all of the following
conditions: (i) all copies of the programs you create must bear a
valid copyright notice, either your own or the KVASER copyright
notice that appears on the Software; (ii) you may not remove or alter
any KVASER copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice
contained in any portion of KVASER libraries, source code,
Redistributables or other files that bear such a notice; (iii) KVASER
provides no warranty at all to any person, other than the Limited
Warranty provided to the original purchaser of the Software, and you
will remain solely responsible to anyone receiving your programs for
support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance, and
such recipients will have no right to contact KVASER for such
services or assistance; (iv) you will indemnify and hold KVASER, its
related companies and its suppliers, harmless from and against any
claims or liabilities arising out of the use, reproduction or
distribution of your programs; (v) your programs must be written
using a licensed copy of the Software; (vi) your programs must add
primary and substantial functionality, and may not be merely a set or
subset of any of the libraries (including runtime libraries), code,
Redistributables or other files of the Software; (vii) regardless of
any modifications which you make and regardless of how you might
compile, link, or package your programs, the libraries (including
runtime libraries), code, Redistributables, and/or other files of the
Software (including any portions thereof) may not be used in programs
created by your end users (i.e., users of your programs) and may not
be further redistributed by your end users; and (viii) you may not
use KVASER's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to
market your programs, except to state that your program was written
using the Software.

The Software might include source code, redistributable files, and/or
other files provided by a third party vendor (Third Party Software).
Since use of Third Party Software might be subject to license
restrictions imposed by the third party vendor, you should refer to
the on-line documentation (if any) provided with Third Party Software
for any license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor.  In
any event, any license restrictions imposed by a third party vendor
are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions of the
License Agreement.

All KVASER libraries, source code, Redistributables and other files
remain KVASER's exclusive property. Regardless of any modifications
that you make, you may not distribute any files (particularly KVASER
source code and other non- executable files) except those that KVASER
has expressly designated as Redistributables.  Nothing in the License
Agreement permits you to derive the source code of files that KVASER
has provided to you in executable form only, or to reproduce, modify,
use, or distribute the source code of such files.  You are not, of
course, restricted from distributing source code or byte code that is
entirely your own.  Source code which you generate with a KVASER
source code generator, such as Kingdom Founder, is considered by
KVASER to be your code.

Contact KVASER for the applicable royalties due and other licensing
terms for all other uses and/or distribution of the Redistributables.


LIMITED WARRANTY
Except with respect to the Redistributables, which are provided "as
is," without warranty of any kind, KVASER warrants that the Software,
as updated and when properly used, will perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying documentation, and the Software
media will be free from defects in materials and workmanship, for a
period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt.  Any implied
warranties on the Software are limited to ninety (90) days.  Some
states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an
implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

KVASER's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive
remedy shall be, at KVASER's option, either (a) return of the price
paid, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software that does not meet
KVASER's Limited Warranty and which is returned to KVASER with a copy
of your receipt.  DO NOT RETURN ANY PRODUCT UNTIL YOU HAVE CALLED THE
KVASER CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND OBTAINED A RETURN
AUTHORIZATION NUMBER.  This Limited Warranty is void if failure of
the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.
Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the
original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.
Neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by
KVASER are available without proof of purchase from an authorized
source.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, KVASER AND ITS
SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, AND THE PROVISION OF
OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES
YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH VARY FROM
STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL KVASER OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER
PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT
SERVICES, EVEN IF KVASER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, KVASER'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION
OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY
PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE
ENTERED INTO AN KVASER SUPPORT SERVICES AGREEMENT, KVASER'S ENTIRE
LIABILITY REGARDING SUPPORT SERVICES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS
OF THAT AGREEMENT. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY
NOT APPLY TO YOU.

HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES
The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured
or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in
hazardous environments requiring fail- safe performance, such as in
the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or
communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support
machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Software
could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). KVASER and its
suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of
fitness for High Risk Activities.


PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
KVASER may have patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights,
or other intellectual property rights covering subject matter in this
Software. Except as expressly provided in any written license
agreement from KVASER, the furnishing of this Software does not give
you any license to these patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other
intellectual property.


GENERAL PROVISIONS
This statement may only be modified in writing signed by you and an
authorized officer of KVASER.  If any provision of this statement is
found void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and
enforceable according to its terms.  If any remedy provided is
determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations
of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in the Limited
Warranty shall remain in effect.

This statement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the
laws of Sweden.  This statement gives you specific legal rights;
you may have others which vary from state to state and from country
to country.  KVASER reserves all rights not specifically granted in
this statement.
