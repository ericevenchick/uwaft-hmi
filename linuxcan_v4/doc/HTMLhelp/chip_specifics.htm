<h5 class=topich>CAN Circuit Specific Notes</h5><p>

<h5 class=subh>Philips 82C200</h5><p>
This circuit is present on the four-channel PCcan boards manufactured before October 1998.
It can't do extended CAN (29-bit identifiers). <p>
<ul>
<li>CANLIB will not return an error code if you try to send an extended
frame with this circuit.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h5 class=subh>Philips SJA1000</h5><p>
This circuit is present on the PCcan-S, PCcan-D, PCcan-F boards,
and on the PCcan-Q boards manufactured after October 1998. (It's also
used in the LAPcan.)
<ul>
<li>When an error flag (frame) is detected, CANLIB will report the
error syndrome from the sja1000 (the contents of the ECC register)
in the identifier, offsetted by 0x800.
</li>
</ul>

<h5 class=subh>Intel 82527</h5><p>
This circuit is present on the PCcan-Q boards.
<ul>
<li>
This circuit has problems with remote frames. When a remote frame is received,
CANLIB will always report the identifier as 0x7FFFFFFF and the DLC as 0.
</li>
<li>
The 82527 has just one double-buffered buffer and this buffer can receive
standard OR extended frames, but not both. The other type must go into
a single-buffered buffer. The type received in the single-buffered buffer
is more prone to overruns. You can control the behaviour in the Registry:
set the REG_DWORD entry
<tt>HKLM\Software\VECTOR\CANDriver 1.0\Options\PCcanOptimizeForExtended_?</tt>
 (where "?" is 0 or 1 depending on which
82527 you want to control) to 0 (for favourizing standard frames) or 1 
(to optimize for extended CAN).
</li>
</ul>
