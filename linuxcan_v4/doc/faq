--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1
    After doing make/make install you get an error like:
    
    make: *** /usr/src/linux-something: No such file or directory. 
    Stop.
 
A1
    This probably means that the kernel source either is not installed or that 
    the path to the kernel source in the settings.mak file is incorrect. 
    The path is typically /usr/src/linux-*the version of the kernel*. 
    However there is often a link to the source directory that can be used 
    (/usr/src/linux). 
    
    In Fedora there doesn't seem to be a link to the kernel source and it is not
    in the *regular* place. In fedora core 4 (kernel 2.6.11) it can be found in
    /usr/src/kernels/2.6.11-1.1369_FC4-i686
    
    The correct path should be entered here in the settings.mak file:
    
    #----------------------------------------
    # Select kernel source folder
    #----------------------------------------
    KERNEL_SOURCE_DIR=/usr/src/linux-`uname -r`
    
    If the kernel source is not installed consult your Linux distribution help
    files on howto do this. 
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2
    After doing make/make install you get an error like:
    
    make: *** No rule to make target '/usr/src/linux-something/config.mak'. Stop. 

A2
    This means that the driver build system got confused regarding where to find
    the config.mak file (seen in openSUSE 10.1).

    The absolute path to the top directory in the driver tree should then be
    entered here in the settings.mak file:
    
    #----------------------------------------
    # Select driver top directory
    #----------------------------------------
    DRIVER_TOP_DIR=/home/john/Sources/linuxcan_v2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Q3
    Compilation succeeded but the driver will not install. You get an error like:
    
    installscript_lapcan_26.sh: line 13: cardctl: command not found
    ...
        
A3
    This probably means that cardctl are not in your path. It is usually found
    in /sbin/.  Add this path to your path and then run make install again. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4
    Compilation succeeded but the driver will not install. You get an error like:

    Permission denied

A4
    To install the driver you have to be logged in as root. 
    
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5
    I have compiled and installed everything but I still cannot get the drivers
    to work.
    
A5.2
    On some computers, the interrupts may not be set up properly. This can
    normally be seen via 'cat /proc/interrupts', which may then show 0 in the
    second column (interrupt count) for the Kvaser hardware even when messages
    should have arrived.
    If that is the case, try starting the kernel with the 'irqfixup' or 'irqpoll'
    boot parameter. See the documentation for your Linux distribution on how to
    do this (Often you edit a line beginning with 'kernel' in
    /boot/grub/menu.lst, to do it permanently. For a temporary test you may be
    able to do it by pressing ESC when the boot-loader is running and then edit
    the corresponding line there before continuing the boot.).
    Both 'irqfixup' and 'irqpoll' have a performance penalty for the kernel,
    especially the latter, so it is preferable not to have to set them.
    It may be possible to correct the interrupt setup by changing options in
    the BIOS. For example, there is likely to be an option regarding plug&play
    OS that it can be a good idea to set so that the BIOS does not do interrupt
    assignments itself (Linux is plug&play capable). There could also be options
    regarding ACPI that may affect things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6
    Is SMP (or fully preemptible kernel) supported?

A6
    While SMP (and fully preemptible kernel) has seen significant
    testing in v4.74alpha, it should still be considered experimental.
    See ReleaseNotes.
    To turn off SMP, use the 'nosmp', 'maxcpus=0', or 'maxcpus=1' kernel boot
    parameters. It may also be possible to turn off CPU cores in the BIOS
    setup. See A5.2 for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7
    The drivers behave strangely, or make my system do so. What's happening?

A7
    Are you running with SMP or a fully preemptible kernel? If so, see Q6.
    Most Linux distributions will default to an SMP install if you are using
    a modern CPU such as P4, Core2 Duo/Quad, Athlon X2 etc.
