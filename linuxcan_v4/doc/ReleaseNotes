================================================================
Known problems in version 4.01 BETA:
================================================================
   * Do not eject a LAPcan card that is currently being 
     used. This could cause a system crash.
   
   * Before removing LAPcan card please unload it 
     ('cardctl eject') to avoid system crasch. This is known to 
     happen for ISA to PCMCIA bridges such as SCM Microsystem Inc's 
     SwapBox with VADEM VG-465 and 469.
   
   * During insertion of LAPcan card it is sometimes not recognized.
     Instead it is recognized as a memory card. Eject card and reinsert it.
     In case that does not help, restart computer.
     See the PCMCIA-HOWTO in case of any further problem.

   * Doing 'make install' when LAPcan card is plugged in might 
     cause error. Eject card before installing ('cardctl eject').

   * During 24 hour tests canReadTimer have had the wrong 
     value a few times.

================================================================
Solved problems in 4.01 BETA:
================================================================
   * pcmcia_core is not loaded when PCIcan is loaded.

================================================================

   * During 24 hour tests canReadTimer have had the wrong 
     value a few times.
    * Firmware bug in PCIcanII and USBcanII that can cause a "jump" in 
     the timestamps (655 ms). 
     This can happen both with the message timestamps and the time read 
     from canReadTimer(). 

================================================================
Known problems in version 4.2:
================================================================
   * Do not eject a LAPcan card that is currently being 
     used. This could cause a system crash.

     it is "off bus".

   * Some problems seen with USBcanII under 64 bit Linux.

   * PCIcanII may not report EAN (likely not real problem).

   * It is possible to continue "using" a driver while it is
     trying to shut down. Nothing useful will happen, but the driver
     can be blocked from unloading indefinitely.
